## Notable Mentions

1- Create application.yml for each environment
Ex: application-dev.yml - application-staging.yml ...

2- using library to map DTO like MapStruct...

3- using soft delete

4- using  environment variables to avoid hard-coding

## 1. Proper packaging style
- You can structure your application with meaningful packaging.
- Proper packaging will help to understand the code and the flow of the application easily.
- You can include all your controllers into a separate package, services in a separate package, util classes into a separate package‚Ä¶etc. This style is very convenient in small-size microservices.
- If you are working on a huge code base, a feature-based approach can be used. 
- You can decide which to adopt, depending on your requirements.

Based on type:

Based on feature:

![feature-based-packaging](feature-based-packaging.webp)

## 2. Use Spring Boot starters
- We can very easily use starter dependencies without adding single dependencies one by one. These starter dependencies are already bundled with the required dependencies.
- Can add these easily using Spring Initializr.
- For example, if we add spring-boot-starter-web dependency, by default it is bundled with jackson, spring-core, spring-mvc, and spring-boot-starter-tomcat dependencies.
- As a result, we don‚Äôt need to care about adding dependencies separately.
- Also, it helps us to avoid version mismatches.

## 3. Use proper versions of the dependencies
- It is always recommended to use the latest stable GA (General Availability) versions.
- Sometimes it may vary with the Java version, server versions, the type of the application, etc.
- Do not use different versions of the same package and always use `<properties>` to specify the version if there are multiple dependencies. For example:

![dependency-versions](dependency-versions.webp)

- Spring boot starters will have their versions defined by the Parent version, and this will automatically configure all the external libraries to be operating on the same versions!
For example:

![dependency-versions-sb-parent](dependency-versions-sb-parent.png)

## 4. Use Lombok
- Lombok is a Java library that is used to reduce boilerplate code and allow you to write clean code using its annotations.
- For example, you may use plenty of lines for getters and setters in some classes like entities, request/response objects, dtos‚Ä¶etc.
- But if you use Lombok, it is just one line, you can use @Data, @Getter or @Setter as per your requirement.
- You can use Lombok logger annotations as well. @Slf4j is recommended.

## 5. Use Controllers only for routing
- Controllers are dedicated to routing.
- It is stateless and singleton.
- The DispatcherServlet will check the @RequestMapping on Controllers.
- Controllers are the ultimate target of requests, then requests will be handed over to the service layer and processed by the service layer.
- The business logic should not be in the controllers.

*For code implementation example(s) check:*
[ProductController.java](https://github.com/arsy786/springboot-best-practices/blob/master/src/main/java/com/javatechie/controller/ProductController.java)

## 6. Use Services for business logic
- The complete business logic goes here with validations, caching‚Ä¶etc.
- Services communicate with the persistence layer and receive the results.
- Services are also singleton.

*For code implementation example(s) check:*
[ProductService.java](https://github.com/arsy786/springboot-best-practices/blob/master/src/main/java/com/javatechie/service/ProductService.java)


## 7. Use constructor injection with Lombok
- When we talk about dependency injection, there are two types.
- One is ‚Äúconstructor injection‚Äù and the other is ‚Äúsetter injection‚Äù. Apart from that, you can also use ‚Äúfield injection‚Äù using the very popular @Autowired annotation.
- But we highly recommend using Constructor injection over other types. Because it allows the application to initialize all required dependencies at the initialization time.
- This is very useful for unit testing.
- The important thing is, that we can use the @RequiredArgsConstructor annotation by Lombok to use constructor injection.

*For code implementation example(s) check:*
[ProductController.java](https://github.com/arsy786/springboot-best-practices/blob/master/src/main/java/com/javatechie/controller/ProductController.java)
or
[ProductService.java](https://github.com/arsy786/springboot-best-practices/blob/master/src/main/java/com/javatechie/service/ProductService.java)


## 8. Use Slf4j logging
- Logging is very important.
- If a problem occurs while your application is in production, logging is the only way to find out the root cause.
- Therefore, you should think carefully before adding loggers, log message types, logger levels, and logger messages.
- Do not use System.out.print()
- Slf4j is recommended to use along with logback which is the default logging framework in Spring Boot.
- Always use slf4j { } and avoid using String interpolation in logger messages. Because string interpolation consumes more memory.
- You can use Lombok @Slf4j annotation to create a logger very easily.
- If you are in a micro-services environment, you can use the ELK stack.

*For code implementation example(s) check:*
[ProductController.java](https://github.com/arsy786/springboot-best-practices/blob/master/src/main/java/com/javatechie/controller/ProductController.java)
or
[ProductService.java](https://github.com/arsy786/springboot-best-practices/blob/master/src/main/java/com/javatechie/service/ProductService.java)
or
[ApiExceptionHandler.java](https://github.com/arsy786/football-club-management-system/blob/master/src/main/java/dev/arsalaan/footballclubmanagementsystem/exception/ApiExceptionHandler.java)


## 9. Use meaningful words for classes, methods, variables and other attributes
- Always use proper meaningful and searchable naming conventions with proper case.
- Usually, we use nouns or short phrases when declaring classes, variables, and constants. Ex: String firstName, const isValid
- You can use verbs and short phrases with adjectives for functions and methods. Ex: readFile(), sendData()
- Avoid using abbreviating variable names and intention revealing names. Ex: int i; String getExUsr;
- If you use this meaningfully, declaration comment lines can be reduced. Since it has meaningful names, a fresh developer can easily understand by reading the code.

![cases](cases.webp)

- There are many cases, as shown above.
- But we need to identify which case is dedicated to which variable.

Most common standard:

classes - PascalCase
<br>
methods & variables - camelCase
<br>
constants - SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
<br>
DB-related fields - snake_case

## 10. Bean Validation
- Apply to DTO's
- Use annotations such as @NotBlank, @Min, @Max, and add messages to each.
- Use @Valid in Controller method attributes for requests to validate against the DTO's.

NOTE: Use the annotations from javax.persistence.* for adding constraints in the Model layer.

NOTE: Use the annotations from javax.validation.constraints.* for adding validation in the DTO layer.

[Team.java](https://github.com/arsy786/football-club-management-system/blob/master/src/main/java/dev/arsalaan/footballclubmanagementsystem/model/Team.java)
or
[ProductRequestDTO.java](https://github.com/arsy786/springboot-best-practices/blob/master/src/main/java/com/javatechie/dto/ProductRequestDTO.java)


## 11. Custom Exception Handling
- This is very important when working with large enterprise-level applications.
- Apart from the general exceptions, we may have some scenarios to identify some specific error cases.
- Exception adviser can be created with @ControllerAdvice and we can create separate exceptions with meaningful details.
- It will make it much easier to identify and debug errors in the future.

*For code implementation example(s) check:*
[exception folder 1](https://github.com/arsy786/football-club-management-system/tree/master/src/main/java/dev/arsalaan/footballclubmanagementsystem/exception)
or
[exception folder 2](https://github.com/raviyasas/springboot-exceptions-demo/tree/master/src/main/java/com/app/exception)

## 12. Use custom response object
- A custom response object can be used to return an object with some specific data with the requirements like HTTP status code, API code, message, etc.

*For code implementation example(s) check:*
[APIResponse.java](https://github.com/arsy786/springboot-best-practices/blob/master/src/main/java/com/javatechie/dto/APIResponse.java)


## 13. Use design patterns
- Know when and where to use which pattern.
- Builder and Singleton most used in SB applications.

## 14. Use yml instead of properties
- Less repetition/duplication of the key prefix.
- More readable.
- Also, use comments in config file to separate which settings belong to which feature.

*For code implementation example(s) check:*
[application.yml](https://github.com/arsy786/springboot-best-practices/blob/master/src/main/resources/application.yml)

## 15. Encrypt or externalize sensitive info
- Encrypt ALL passwords (never store as plain text).
- Move outside of codebase (Vault, git server, cloud config, etc.)

## 16. Write E2E Unit Test cases with coverage
- This is done to validate all features and API's are working as expected.
- Mocking Repository, we do not want the test data to save to the DB, so mocking behaviour helps us bypass DB interactions.
- Test ALL endpoints (or methods).
- Test positive AND negative scenarios for each endpoint.
- Running the code with Coverage allows us to indetify which parts of the code have been tested or not.
- Aim for 100% coverage!

*For code implementation example(s) check:*
[footballclubmanagementsystem tests](https://github.com/arsy786/football-club-management-system/tree/master/src/test/java/dev/arsalaan/footballclubmanagementsystem)
or
[TeamMockMvcIT.java](https://github.com/arsy786/football-club-management-system/blob/master/src/test/java/dev/arsalaan/footballclubmanagementsystem/TeamMockMvcIT.java)
or
[ProductServiceApplicationTests.java](https://github.com/arsy786/springboot-best-practices/blob/master/src/test/java/com/javatechie/ProductServiceApplicationTests.java)

## 17. Avoid NPE by using Optional
- In Java 8, to avoid NullPointerException you can use Optional<T> from java.util.package.
- Can use:

``` java
Optional.ofNullable(object)

// or

productRepository.findById(productId).orElseThrow(
() -> new ProductNotFoundException("product not found with id: " + productId))
```

## 18. Use best practices for the collection framework
- Use appropriate collection (data structure) for your data set.
- Use forEach with Java 8 features and avoid using legacy for loops.
- pre- and post-Java 8 comparison:

``` java
// pre-Java8

// post-Java 8

```
- Functional programming is better for performance and readability.
- Use interface type instead of the implementation.
- Use isEmpty() over size() for better readability.
- Do not return null values, you can return an empty collection.


## 19. Use Caching
- Caching is another important factor when talking about application performance.
- It reduces the round trip of your request from your application to the DB (if no changes were detected).
- By default, Spring Boot provides caching with ConcurrentHashMap and you can achieve this by @EnableCaching annotation.
- If you are not satisfied with default caching, you can use Redis, Hazelcast, or any other distributed caching implementations.
- Redis and Hazelcast are in-memory caching methods. You also can use database cache implementations as well.

## 20. Use Pagination
- This is useful if you have lots of records, it allows us to view the data more easily.
- This will improve the performance of the application.
- If you‚Äôre using Spring Data JPA, the PagingAndSortingRepository makes using pagination very easy and with little effort.

## 21. Remove unnecessary codes, variables, methods
- Unused variable declarations will acquire some memory.
- Remove unused methods, classes, imports, vars etc. because it will impact the performance of the application.
- Try to avoid nested loops. You can use maps instead.

## 22. Use Comments
- Commenting is a good practice unless you abuse it.
- DO NOT comment on everything. Instead, you can write descriptive code using meaningful words for classes, functions, methods, variables‚Ä¶etc.
- Remove commented codes, misleading comments, and story-type comments.
- You can use comments for warnings and explain something difficult to understand at first sight.
- Example:

``` java
/** this method will fetch product from DB by ID
* @param productId
* @return product response from DB
*/
```

## 23. Use a common code formatting style
- Have a consistent and uniform way of formatting your code.
- Use spaces and/or returns in an ordered and readable manner.
- CMD+OPTION+L on highlighted code in IDE for code reformatting!
- Can see below, two different ways of formatting the same code. To avoid discrepancies, the team should have a common coding format.


![code-formatting](code-formatting.webp)

## 24. Use SonarLint
- This is very useful for identifying small bugs and best practices to avoid unnecessary bugs and code quality issues.
- You can install the plugin into your favorite IDE.


## 25. Be Simple!
- Always try to write readable, understanble and simple code!
